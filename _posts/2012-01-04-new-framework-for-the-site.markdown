I have transitioned to using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) for building this site and it is now being hosted on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com).  I just make changes to the source for the site and Github takes care of running Jekyll when I push changes to them.  In this new configuration, the blogging stuff is integrated with the rest of the site; previously I had a Wordpress blog that I included as an iframe element, but that's rather clunky.

In addition, I am rendering LaTeX using [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/), which simply requires the inclusion of a javascript snippet in the head of the page.
