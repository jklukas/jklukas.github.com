<p>Although I'm actually an Ohio native, I grew up in the South Hills of Pittsburgh (which, make no mistake, is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States#Cultural_overlap">a Midwestern city</a> despite being in Pennsylvania).  My parents, who both grew up as good Lutheran kids, met in college at <a href="www.wittenberg.edu">Wittenberg University</a>, and despite showing impressive restraint during my college search, were both quite happy to see me follow tradition by attending their alma mater.

<p>While at Wittenberg, I fully embraced the liberal arts philosophy by casting a wide net with my studies and delaying a choice of major until the last possible moment.  I managed to straddle the divide between the humanities and the sciences for a while by pursuing majors in both physics and French language and literature.  The French studies took me on a sidetrack to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senegal">Senegal</a> for a semester of studying language, art, and culture in Dakar.  Back in Springfield, my extracurricular activities included the production of a moderately embarrasing acoustic rock <a href="http://jeffklukas.bandcamp.com/">album</a>.

<p>During my time at Wittenberg, I started to become more aware of my appreciation for the good work being done by my professors and the enjoyment of struggling to communicate new ideas to those on the great journey of learning physics.  Those experiences led me to graduate school to prepare for a career in teaching and research.  I moved to Madison, WI to pursue a physics Ph.D., and was immediately seduced by the field of experimental particle physics and the promises it held of international collaboration and travel.  As a result, I became involved with the <a href="http://cms.cern.ch/">Compact Muon Solenoid experiment</a>, one of the main detectors at the <a href=http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/lhc/lhc-en.html>Large Hadron Collider</a> on the French/Swiss border.  I am currently involved in validation work for the experiment's muon trigger system as well as analysis focused on the physics of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_and_Z_bosons">W and Z bosons</a>.

<p>In 2007, I married Karen Obee, my college sweetheart and a native of Toledo, OH.  Life got significantly more complicated and exciting in 2011 with the birth of our daughter, Emilia.  She's a hoot.  Karen is currently working at Edgewood College in student affairs.

<p>Since arriving in Madison, I've pursued professional development in teaching through the <a href="http://delta.wisc.edu/">Delta program in Research, Teaching, and Learning</a>. I developed <a href="../teaching/"> a workshop on facilitating cooperative group work</a> for instructors, which I've presented in various contexts at UW-Madison and at CU-Boulder through Delta's exchange program.  I have been a teaching assistant for both calculus-based and algebra-based physics at Madison and taught the physics portion of <a href="http://www.prehealth.wisc.edu/apply/uw_mcat.html">the university's MCAT preparation course</a> for two years.

<p>The good stuff, though, came during the 2010-2011 academic year, when I had the opportunity to more seriously pursue my teaching ambitions with a lecturing position at he Univeristy of Wisconsin - Whitewater.  I received some great mentoring from the physics faculty there and got to experience the full responsibility of developing and administering my own courses.  Responses from the students were quite encouraging, and I hope to find a permanent teaching position as I finish my Ph.D.

<p>Jeff Klukas grew up in Pittsburgh, PA and moved to Springfield, OH to attend college at Wittenberg University.  In 2006, he graduated with a B.S. degree and double majors in physics and French.  On the way to that degree, he spent a semester in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senegal">Senegal</a>, studying language, art, and culture in Dakar.

<p>After undergrad, he moved to Madison, WI to start work on a Ph.D. in physics, where his desire to return to the French-speaking world led him to study experimental particle physics.  He now works on the <a href="http://cms.cern.ch/">Compact Muon Solenoid experiment</a> at <a href=http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/lhc/lhc-en.html>the Large Hadron Collider</a> on the French/Swiss border.  He spends about 2 months per year at the LHC, collaborating with colleagues on physics analysis and running shifts in the CMS control room.

<p>In 2007, he married his college sweetheart Karen Obee, who now works at Edgewood College in student affairs.  Karen is a native of Toledo, OH.
