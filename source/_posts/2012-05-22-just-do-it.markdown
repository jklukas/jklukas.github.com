* Made $300 in one morning by doing some hacking in response to a blog post.
* Rebuilt ac-aa.org in Wordpress so that minor changes can be handled by members of the community rather than having to go through me.
* Learned the basics of MVC web apps and Ruby on Rails
* Attended some meetups to get involved with the community.
* Cleaned up the source code for my thesis and published a LaTeX style configuration on Github that I hope other UW dissertators will use to make their lives easier.
