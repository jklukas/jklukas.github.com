Starting a new job with [Epic](http://epic.com) on Monday, working with their Server Systems team to provide configuration, deployment, and monitoring of high-performance databases for large healthcare systems.  The past few weeks have given me some rare downtime, though, to throw effort at a few projects that had been on my mind.  A few of the things I've accomplished during my gap time:

* Made $300 in one morning by doing some hacking in response to [a tweet](https://twitter.com/planetpython/status/203147081005805569).
* Rebuilt [ac-aa.org](http://ac-aa.org) in Wordpress so that minor changes can be handled directly by members of the ACAA community rather than having to go through me.
* Learned the basics of MVC web apps and Ruby on Rails, inspired by the prodding of some of the good folks at [Bendyworks](http://bendyworks.com).
* Attended some Madison-area software meetups to get better acquainted with the local tech ecosystem.
* Cleaned up the source code for my thesis and published a LaTeX style configuration on Github that I hope other UW dissertators will use to make their lives easier.
