My blogging frequency has been embarrassingly low, confirming my suspicions that I'm a lot more interested in the technical side of setting up the site than writing content.  Part of the problem is that [Octopress](http://octopress.org), my chosen blogging framework, has turned out to be a bit cumbersome.  I was lured in by the idea that my whole blog would just be text files -- no database, nothing hidden, I would be able to control and understand everything.  While I've certainly learned a lot by using Octopress, posting new content involves having a properly setup development environment on whatever machine you're using.  By the time a month has gone by and I finally get around to thinking of something new to add to the blog, I've completely forgotten how things work and I'm confronted with some new hurdle that stops me from pushing my new post to the site.

That said, I now understand just how nice it is to be able to post to write a blog post through a web interface, from whatever machine you happen to come across.  So I'm ready to admit it might be worth using a database.  Recently, I've gotten fairly heavily involved in development for an internal Q&A site at Epic based on the open source Django app [OSQA](http://www.osqa.net), which has gotten me interested in trying out a Django-based blog.  Working in python will make me feel significantly more comfortable and it's a good chance to get to know the process of developing a Django app from scratch.

If I make posting easier, then maybe there's some chance this will become something a bit more diverse than a blog about blogging.
