ROOT is a powerful data analysis tool within the particle physics community, and the primary lens through which we see our data. The framework includes quite a bit of graphical capability, but this has understandably not been the first priority in designing its capabilities or its interface.  By exploiting the pyROOT interface to the Python interpreter, I created the [RootPlot package](http://packages.python.org/rootplot) to provide scripts and libraries to make working with the graphical side of ROOT easier.

Of particular note, it easily allows the user to output images through matplotlib, a more full-featured plotting package, to achieve results more attractive than possible with ROOT alone.
